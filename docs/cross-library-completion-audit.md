# Cross-library completion audit

The project goal is an evidence-backed claim that Cangjie exceeds FreeType,
HarfBuzz, Fontations/Skrifa, and Parley in both relevant functionality and
performance. This is intentionally stronger than passing unit tests or winning
one benchmark. The claim remains **open** until every row below is closed.

## Required evidence

| Reference | Concrete completion criterion | Current artifact/evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HarfBuzz | Exact glyph IDs, clusters, advances, offsets, and relevant flags across retained upstream and production-font corpora | `shaping-parity-smoke`, `shaping-corpus-parity-smoke`, `tests/data/`, `docs/shaping-parity.md` | Strong retained coverage, not exhaustive |
| HarfBuzz/HarfRust | Faster than the faster reference on every representative shaping workload, with independent binaries, pinned CPU, symmetric order, and repeatable margin | `shaping-performance-matrix` | Open: the new Devanagari output specialization moves the retained row to about `1.03x`, but Amiri words remains a near tie and `react-dom.txt` is not yet in this performance matrix |
| Fontations/Skrifa | Every pinned public table/API family mapped to a live test; shared high-level operations semantically equivalent and faster at matched lifecycle boundaries | `docs/fontations-coverage.json`, `fontations-coverage`, `fontations-matrix` | Inventory complete; broader semantic differentials and owning-outline stability remain open |
| FreeType | Correct outline/hinting/bitmap behavior plus faster matched cold, owning, reused, and prepared raster lifecycles across glyf/CFF/CFF2, bitmap/color, representative scripts, and sizes | `hinting-freetype-test`, `glyph-bench`, raster evidence in `docs/shaping-parity.md` | Open: current evidence is strongest for repeated direct grayscale raster; full lifecycle/format matrix is incomplete |
| Parley | Equivalent paragraph layout results—not only counts—and faster default/styled/reflow paths for Latin, Arabic, CJK, bidi, vertical, fallback, and inline-object workloads | `parley-matrix`, paragraph/reflow tests, `docs/text-pipeline.md` | Open: current matrix covers three scripts and three style modes, but cross-engine checksum semantics and several layout modes are not equivalent/comparable |
| Robustness | Malformed supported inputs fail atomically under safety checks and sustained coverage-guided fuzzing | `font-fuzz-smoke`, `font-fuzz`, regression fixtures | Open: the retained 100K campaign is useful evidence, not exhaustive format coverage |
| Platform scope | Results reproduced on each supported target or the performance claim explicitly scoped to named hardware/OS/toolchain versions | benchmark documentation | Open: current performance evidence is primarily one Linux x86-64 host |

## Audit rules

1. A semantic manifest proves inventory only; it is not a differential test.
2. Stable self-checksums prove determinism only; cross-library layout claims
   require normalized comparable outputs.
3. Performance rows must compare the same work and lifecycle. Cache/prepared
   paths cannot replace cold or owning rows.
4. A row is a win only when repeated symmetric runs clear a declared noise
   margin; a `0.997x` or `1.001x` observation is a tie, not superiority.
5. Every retained optimization must preserve the full ReleaseFast suite and
   all applicable reference-parity gates.
6. The overall claim may be made only after every open row above has concrete,
   reproducible evidence.

## Current conclusion

Cangjie is already ahead in the maintained 19-case Fontations/Skrifa matrix,
the nine-case Parley timing matrix, the retained FreeType repeated-direct
grayscale probes, and most of the five-corpus shaping matrix. That evidence is
substantial but does not satisfy the stronger overall claim. In particular,
the latest shaping runs still place Amiri words near parity; Devanagari now
leads the retained row by about `1.03x`, but that is only one font/corpus. The
broader FreeType/Parley lifecycle and semantic matrices remain incomplete.
